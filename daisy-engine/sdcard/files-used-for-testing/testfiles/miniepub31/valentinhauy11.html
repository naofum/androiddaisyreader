				In this study the life and works of Valentin Haüy are described.

    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0006">
				Valentin Haüy (1745-1821), of many called the father of the education of the blind,
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0007">
				founded a school for blind children of both sexes in Paris in 1785.
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0008">
				In 1786 he published the first known book about education for the blind.
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0009">
				His main idea was the necessity of educating the blind to an independent life.
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0010">
				Thus the blind were trained for different professions such as printing, basket making, sewing etc.
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0011">
				Another of Haüys ideas was that blind children should not be segregated but educated together with sighted children.
			</span>
    <span class="sentence" id="rgn_cnt_0012">
				His method of printing books with letters in relief and ink-print was a minor revolution that enabled the blind to read books.
